# EigenEdge
Computing with Eigenvalue Distributions of Large Random Matrices

The **EigenEdge** MATLAB package contains open source implementations 
of methods for working with eigenvalue distributions of large random matrices 
of the covariance type. 


## Contents 


* methods to compute the limit empirical spectrum of sample covariance matrices: **Atomic**, fixed point and Newton. *Atomic* is described in: 
*Dobriban, E.* : Precise Computation of Limit Spectra of Sample Covariance Matrices
* methods to compute arbitrary moments and quantiles of the limit spectrum 
* Matlab scripts to reproduce all computational results of the above paper
* experiments documenting the fractal behavior of Newton's method
* a detailed documentation with examples
