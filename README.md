# EigenEdge
Computing with Eigenvalue Distributions of Large Random Matrices

The **EigenEdge** MATLAB package contains open source implementations 
of methods for working with eigenvalue distributions of large random matrices 
of the covariance type. 

In particular, it contains the **Atomic** method to compute the limit
empirical spectrum of sample covariance matrices. This is described in:
